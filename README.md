# Game Idea:
The player will will be piloting the legendary mythical Stratos-X, which they crafted using leaked top-secret
blueprints stolen from Core Sec. Core Sec is after you. The goal is to wipe out Core Sec drones in 5 waves; then defeat the final boss:

**The Core Sec Battleship**
*⚠️Scanner Warning⚠️*

# Plans:

- Will be an exe file run in the console.
- The 'display' in the terminal will be outlined using ASCII art. The player will be advised to zoom out if it is not displaying properly.
- The graphics will be printed inside this ascii outline, mainly using the characters ` ░▒▓█•`, which will be individually colors, like pixels on a screen. 
- The game will have simple beeps for sound effects. I've heard these beeps are sort of build in to the Windows OS, and can easily be played using one line of code, at least using Assembly. Bonus if I can get it to play an mp3 file of "Broke For Free - Covered In Oil" for the Core Sec Battleship boss.
- There must be some ascii art of the Stratos ship at some point in the game. If plausible, it is preferred to make the player character looks somewhat like a Stratos, rather than a pixel or two.
